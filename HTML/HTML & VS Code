----------------- HTML & VS Code Simple & Basic Introduction ------------------

Whats HTML ?
- HTML gives your website structure or provide symentics

HTML - Simple language

All Programming languages are popular bcz - all have different web frameworks
E.g. Javascript --> Web framework - Express, React, Angular, Vue

Steps to start HTML -
1] Create folder --> html
2] Drag & drop in --> vs code
3] Create file --> index.html

Shortcut In VS code - 
! + tab ==> Auto make Boiler plate code 

Q.- How did boiler plate code come ? or Why did we create the index. file?
=>
- 1st popular S/W or web server - Apache2  --> Mostly the Linux system you see runs only Apache S/W
- Behind the scene of Cpanel, hostinger, godaddy, bigrock etc. Apache s/w run.
- This s/w serve your web pages.
  - In these s/w default configiration you not mention any file this s/w directly serve this index.html file these are common index.js, index.html..

Industry base html write through --> Emmet documentation

Emmet documentation - we write fast pace code.
*NOTE - Working of Emmet Abberivation can show through FOLDER opening not for file only(onpen in VScode)
     1] - Emmet have require folder or structure for serve.
	   2] - file name have index.html & save after it.

Shortcut In VS code - 
! + tab + tab ==> directly goes into document in html code
   
Working of index.html -
- File (index.html) - 1st this file load into memory then after it serve in browser(chrome).
- Live server (extension) - this extension used for AUTO reload file into memory & it serve in browser.

Q. - Ok, it is also important to know, how they html work auto reload through live server?
=>	
  - Just Right Click & open page source code
	- We see extra script can load they inject from live server.
	- Is there any program which is telling the memory again and again that if there are any changes in the file, then reload it.
        		OR
  - Live server preview (2nd extension) - Ctrl + Shift + p 
    - problem with this extension we can't fetch title, on right click don't go to page source & browser functionality like inspect element not open.
